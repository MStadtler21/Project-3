## Haven't You Heard About HEARD?

## What is Heard?

Heard is a responsive web-based application designed to improve inventory and order management for locally owned restaurants and bars. 

As a restaurant manager, you need to keep track of your inventory, and when you need to order more product, you need to be able to make decisions quickly and efficiently to reduce cost and keep your employees focused on serving customers. Heard makes your life easier by taking the guesswork out of inventory management. Simply assign user accounts to your managers, and they will be able to log into the app to track inventory from the database and add new orders to be sent to your distributor. 

## Order Management 

With Heard, sending orders is simple! Enter the information into the application. If an order is ready, you can convert it to PDF in app. The PDF can then be emailed directly to your distributor - the days of painstakingly pecking around spreadsheets or scribbling on beer-stained notepads in a damp basement are OVER!
